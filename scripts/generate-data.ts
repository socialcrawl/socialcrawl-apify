/**
 * Regenerate src/data/endpoints.ts and src/data/platforms.ts from the
 * backend registry dump.
 *
 * Pipeline:
 *   1. In the backend repo:  cd codebase/packages/social-api
 *      pnpm dlx tsx scripts/extract-mcp-data.ts
 *      → writes registry-dump.json at this repo's root.
 *   2. Here:                 npm run generate:data
 *
 * Platform display names, endpoint counts, params, credit tiers/costs,
 * archetypes, and doc strings all come straight from the dump (which is
 * derived from the live registry — the backend's single source of truth).
 * Platform DESCRIPTIONS are maintained in this script: the script fails
 * loudly when the dump contains a platform without a description so new
 * platforms can't ship undocumented.
